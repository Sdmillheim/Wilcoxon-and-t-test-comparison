# Wilcoxon-and-t-test-comparison
A Monte Carlo Comparison of the Wilcoxon Test and the t-test

Calculates results of the Wilcoxon test and t-tests on data drawn from uniform, normal, exponential, and Cauchy distributions with progressive mean shifts.
Repeats this for three different sample sizes. 
Conducts 1,200,000 hypothesis tests for each test/distribution/sample-size combination. 
Graphs proportion rejected vs mean shift to get a numerical approximation of a power function for each test/data combination.
